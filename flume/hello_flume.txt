>> Apache Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available system for efficiently collecting, 
   aggregating and moving large amounts of log data from many different sources to a 
   centralized data store.

>> An Agent consists of Source, Channel & Sink.

>> Flume agent configuration is stored in a local configuration file.The configuration file 
   includes properties of each source, sink and channel in an agent and how they are wired 
   together to form data flows.

Scenario #1: Given a Flume configuration file, start a Flume agent

Let's get configuration file first for the Flume agent. You can make your own.
	$ wget media.sundog-soft.com/hadoop/example.conf

Let's see it's content:
	$ less example.conf
	press q to exit.

Let's go to Flume Server:
	cd /usr/hdp/current/flume-server/


Let's run the Flume Agent now:
	$ bin/flume-ng agent --conf conf --conf-file ~/example.conf --name a1 -Dflume.root.logger=INFO,console

Let's open new session with Putty and connect to the sandbox and type below command:
	$ telnet localhost 44444

Now send some text, say Hello Flume!!
The message will flow through the Flume agent in the next putty session and you can see it coming over there.

Step 1: Create a file hello_pig.txt with content as hello pig!!
vi hello_pig.txt, type hello pig!! and quit.

Step 2: Move this file from Linux system to HDFS system.
hadoop fs -put hello_pig.txt /user/maria_dev/hive_hands_on/

Step 3: Let's launch pig, by typing simply pig. You will be in a shell - grunt.
grunt>

Step 4: Let's load the file and then show it as output.
grunt> r = load '/user/maria_dev/hive_hands_on/hello_pig.txt';
grunt> dump r;

After the exectuion of the mappers and reducers internally, you will be prompted with
"hello pig!!"

Step 5: Let's save this script using vi editor or any other editors.
first quit grunt.
grunt>quit;

launch vi editor.
$> vi first_pig.pig 
Note - saving file as *.pig is optional.

copy paste the code and write and exit vi editor by typing esc then wq enter.
r = load '/user/maria_dev/hive_hands_on/hello_pig.txt';
dump r;

Test if the file has proper code or not.
$>cat first_pig, you should see the code you have written in the file.

Step 6: let's execute this pig script from grunt.
grunt> exec first_pig.pig;

Step 7:let's execute pig from the root prompt -
grunt> pig -f first_pig.pig
